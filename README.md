# R_sentiment

The following script for R installs dependencies, creates OAuth authentication handshake, and performs a geolocation search based on search terms, resulting in a DataFrame.  The text field is then parsed using the syuzhet R package, and appended with sentiment values.  The resulting CSV file can be transformed into a shapefile.
