# R_twitter_sentiment

The following script ("sentiment.R") for R installs dependencies, creates an OAuth authentication handshake, and performs a geolocation search based on search terms, resulting in a dataframe.  The text field is then parsed using the syuzhet R package and appended with sentiment values.  The resulting dataframe can be exported to a CSV, then transformed into a shapefile.
